							<div class="text">The UI of Spotify's website is not painful for the eyes because of the color combination plus the use of the dark color. Spotifyâ€™s interface is very easy to use because of the good placements of the buttons and easily understandable labels. if you are a new user you can easily understand how to create your playlists.</div>

							<div class="text2">This is one of the examples of bad designing of a website. The color combination is bad and the texts, because some are small and some are big. This website's texts are hard to read and hard to understand because of the sizes and the proper formatting of the contents. I suggest that they should re-organize the content of their website and change their fonts. They need to include a navigation bar so the website will be easily navigated for the new user.</div>
